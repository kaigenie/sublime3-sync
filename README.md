sublime3-sync
=============

Sync my Sublime text editor between different system. 

I had several windows 7 system at home and office that I don't want to setup the package control and plugins everytime
I need to. 

So I download the portable Sublime Text 3 and setup the once and then I could pull everyting from other systems.

Just for personal use.

It now include Following plugins

Package Control
DocBlockr
Emmet
ABAP syntax
